Segmentation of UV/Visible Light Images of Shale Samples Using Machine Learning


Here
we garnered an approach using machine learning to solve for the lithology of sidewall samples increase sample recognition time. Using a machine learning
method and neural networks, we segmented ultraviolet light images and visible light images of shale samples using a sample size of 1500 side wall samples to
predict the lithology of the samples. Project initiated using Tensorflow and Keras within R.
